Design a systemverilog RTL module for Weighted Round Robin Arbiter with Atomic Lock Support based on the provided `Specification.md`.

The atomic lock component is critical for a high-performance bus interconnect where different agents (clients) require varying Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees and the ability to perform uninterrupted operations.

The design must:
1.  **Arbitrate** access among $N$ clients using a weighted round-robin policy.
2.  **Support Atomic Locks**, allowing a granted client to hold the bus indefinitely for critical sections.
3.  **Ensure Work Conservation**, preventing idle bus cycles if a granted client finishes early.
4.  **Be Parameterized**, supporting a configurable number of clients and weight widths.
5.  **Compatibility**, design must be compatible with iverilog and have the `timescale 1ns/1ps.
